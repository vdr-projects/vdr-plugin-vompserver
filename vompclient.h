/*
  The new async protocol design forced the server side change from the mvpclient
  class to the mess it is now. Maybe in a couple of versions time it will become
  more apparent how better to design all this.
  
  The reason for the class split is that with the current Thread class system,
  you can only have one thread per object. The vompclient class would have needed
  two, one for RR stuff and one for the keepalives.
  
  So the new design is this: the VompClient class represents one connection from
  one client as the MVPClient class did before. But because two threads are now
  needed, a helper class VompClientRRProc contains all the RR processing functions,
  and the thread needed to process them. All the state data is still kept in the
  VompClient class.
